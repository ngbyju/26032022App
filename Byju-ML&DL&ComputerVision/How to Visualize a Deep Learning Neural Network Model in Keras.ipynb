    "Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into 4 parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Model\n",
    "Summarize Model\n",
    "Visualize Model\n",
    "Best Practice Tips\n",
    "Example Model\n",
    "We can start off by defining a simple multilayer Perceptron model in Keras that we can use as the subject for summarization and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we will define has one input variable, a hidden layer with two neurons, and an output layer with one binary output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1 input] -> [2 neurons] -> [1 output]\n",
    "If you are new to Keras or deep learning, see this step-by-step Keras tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code listing for this network is provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dense\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Dense(2, input_dim=1, activation='relu'))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n",
    "Summarize Model\n",
    "Keras provides a way to summarize a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary is textual and includes information about:\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers and their order in the model.\n",
    "The output shape of each layer.\n",
    "The number of parameters (weights) in each layer.\n",
    "The total number of parameters (weights) in the model.\n",
    "The summary can be created by calling the summary() function on the model that returns a string that in turn can be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the updated example that prints a summary of the created model.\n",

    "_________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #\n",

    "We can clearly see the output shape and number of weights in each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize Model\n",
    "The summary is useful for simple models, but can be confusing for models that have multiple inputs or outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras also provides a function to create a plot of the network neural network graph that can make more complex models easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot_model() function in Keras will create a plot of your network. This function takes a few useful arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "model: (required) The model that you wish to plot.\n",
    "to_file: (required) The name of the file to which to save the plot.\n",
    "show_shapes: (optional, defaults to False) Whether or not to show the output shapes of each layer.\n",
    "show_layer_names: (optional, defaults to True) Whether or not to show the name for each layer.\n",
    "Below is the updated example that plots the created model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the example assumes that you have the graphviz graph library and the Python interface installed.\n",

    "Best Practice Tips\n",
    "I generally recommend to always create a summary and a plot of your neural network model in Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend this for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm layer order. It is easy to add layers in the wrong order with the sequential API or to connect them together incorrectly with the functional API. The graph plot can help you confirm that the model is connected the way you intended.\n",
    "Confirm the output shape of each layer. It is common to have problems when defining the shape of input data for complex networks like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The summary and plot can help you confirm the input shape to the network is as you intended.\n",
    "Confirm parameters. Some network configurations can use far fewer parameters, such as the use of a TimeDistributed wrapped Dense layer in an Encoder-Decoder recurrent neural network. Reviewing the summary can help spot cases of using far more parameters than expected.\n",
