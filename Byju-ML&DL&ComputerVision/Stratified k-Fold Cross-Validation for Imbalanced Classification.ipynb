    "Evaluating a classification model is challenging because we won’t know how good a model is until it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we must estimate the performance of a model using available data where we already have the target or outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model evaluation involves more than just evaluating a model; it includes testing different data preparation schemes, different learning algorithms, and different hyperparameters for well-performing learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model = Data Preparation + Learning Algorithm + Hyperparameters\n",
    "Ideally, the model construction procedure (data preparation, learning algorithm, and hyperparameters) with the best score (with your chosen metric) can be selected and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model evaluation procedure is to split a dataset into two parts and use one part for training a model and the second part for testing the model. As such, the parts of the dataset are named for their function, train set and test set respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is effective if your collected dataset is very large and representative of the problem. The number of examples required will differ from problem to problem, but may be thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of examples to be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A split of 50/50 for train and test would be ideal, although more skewed splits are common, such as 67/33 or 80/20 for train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We rarely have enough data to get an unbiased estimate of performance using a train/test split evaluation of a model. Instead, we often have a much smaller dataset than would be preferred, and resampling strategies must be used on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used model evaluation scheme for classifiers is the 10-fold cross-validation procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-fold cross-validation procedure involves splitting the training dataset into k folds. The first k-1 folds are used to train a model, and the holdout kth fold is used as the test set. This process is repeated and each of the folds is given an opportunity to be used as the holdout test set. A total of k models are fit and evaluated, and the performance of the model is calculated as the mean of these runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure has been shown to give a less optimistic estimate of model performance on small training datasets than a single train/test split. A value of k=10 has been shown to be effective across a wide range of dataset sizes and model types."
