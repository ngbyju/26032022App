    "Label Propagation is a semi-supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm was proposed in the 2002 technical report by Xiaojin Zhu and Zoubin Ghahramani titled “Learning From Labeled And Unlabeled Data With Label Propagation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for the algorithm is that a graph is created that connects all examples (rows) in the dataset based on their distance, such as Euclidean distance. Nodes in the graph then have label soft labels or label distribution based on the labels or label distributions of examples connected nearby in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many semi-supervised learning algorithms rely on the geometry of the data induced by both labeled and unlabeled examples to improve on supervised methods that use only the labeled data. This geometry can be naturally represented by an empirical graph g = (V,E) where nodes V = {1,…,n} represent the training data and edges E represent similarities between them\n",
    "\n",
    "— Page 193, Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propagation refers to the iterative nature that labels are assigned to nodes in the graph and propagate along the edges of the graph to connected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is sometimes called label propagation, as it “propagates” labels from the labeled vertices (which are fixed) gradually through the edges to all the unlabeled vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "— Page 48, Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning, 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations to strengthen the labels assigned to unlabeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with nodes 1, 2,…,l labeled with their known label (1 or −1) and nodes l + 1,…,n labeled with 0, each node starts to propagate its label to its neighbors, and the process is repeated until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "— Page 194, Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are familiar with the Label Propagation algorithm, let’s look at how we might use it on a project. First, we must define a semi-supervised classification dataset."
