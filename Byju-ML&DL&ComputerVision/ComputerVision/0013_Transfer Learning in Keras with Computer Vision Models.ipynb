    "The use of a pre-trained model is limited only by your creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a model may be downloaded and used as-is, such as embedded into an application and used to classify new photographs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, models may be downloaded and use as feature extraction models. Here, the output of the model from a layer prior to the output layer of the model is used as input to a new classifier model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that convolutional layers closer to the input layer of the model learn low-level features such as lines, that layers in the middle of the layer learn complex abstract features that combine the lower level features extracted from the input, and layers closer to the output interpret the extracted features in the context of a classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this understanding, a level of detail for feature extraction from an existing pre-trained model can be chosen. For example, if a new task is quite different from classifying objects in photographs (e.g. different to ImageNet), then perhaps the output of the pre-trained model after the few layers would be appropriate. If a new task is quite similar to the task of classifying objects in photographs, then perhaps the output from layers much deeper in the model can be used, or even the output of the fully connected layer prior to the output layer can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-trained model can be used as a separate feature extraction program, in which case input can be pre-processed by the model or portion of the model to a given an output (e.g. vector of numbers) for each input image, that can then use as input when training a new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, the pre-trained model or desired portion of the model can be integrated directly into a new neural network model. In this usage, the weights of the pre-trained can be frozen so that they are not updated as the new model is trained. Alternately, the weights may be updated during the training of the new model, perhaps with a lower learning rate, allowing the pre-trained model to act like a weight initialization scheme when training the new model.\n",
    "\n",

    "Classifier: The pre-trained model is used directly to classify new images\n",

    "Standalone Feature Extractor: The pre-trained model, or some portion of the model, is used to pre-process images and extract relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Feature Extractor: The pre-trained model, or some portion of the model, is integrated into a new model, but layers of the pre-trained model are frozen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight Initialization: The pre-trained model, or some portion of the model, is integrated into a new model, and the layers of the pre-trained model are trained in concert with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each approach can be effective and save significant time in developing and training a deep convolutional neural network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear as to which usage of the pre-trained model may yield the best results on your new computer vision task, therefore some experimentation may be required."

    "GoogLeNet (e.g. InceptionV3).\n",

    "The first time a pre-trained model is loaded, Keras will download the required model weights, which may take some time given the speed of your internet connection. Weights are stored in the .keras/models/ directory under your home directory and will be loaded from this location the next time that they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "When loading a given model, the “include_top” argument can be set to False, in which case the fully-connected output layers of the model used to make predictions is not loaded, allowing a new output layer to be added and trained. For example:\n",

    "...\n",
    "# load model without output layer\n",
    "model = VGG16(include_top=False)\n",

    "A model without a top will output activations from the last convolutional or pooling layer directly. One approach to summarizing these activations for thier use in a classifier or as a feature vector representation of input is to add a global pooling layer, such as a max global pooling or average global pooling. The result is a vector that can be used as a feature descriptor for an input. Keras provides this capability directly via the ‘pooling‘ argument that can be set to ‘avg‘ or ‘max‘. For example:\n",

    "\n",

    "# prepare an image\n",
    "from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input\n",

    "Finally, you may wish to use a model architecture on your dataset, but not use the pre-trained weights, and instead initialize the model with random weights and train the model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by setting the ‘weights‘ argument to None instead of the default ‘imagenet‘. Additionally, the ‘classes‘ argument can be set to define the number of classes in your dataset, which will then be configured for you in the output layer of the model. For example:\n",
