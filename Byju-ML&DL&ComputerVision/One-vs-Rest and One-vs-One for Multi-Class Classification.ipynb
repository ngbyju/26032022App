    "Binary Classifiers for Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "Classification is a predictive modeling problem that involves assigning a class label to an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification are those tasks where examples are assigned exactly one of two classes. Multi-class classification is those tasks where examples are assigned exactly one of more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Classification: Classification tasks with two classes.\n",
    "Multi-class Classification: Classification tasks with more than two classes.\n",
    "Some algorithms are designed for binary classification problems. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "Perceptron\n",
    "Support Vector Machines\n",
    "As such, they cannot be used for multi-class classification tasks, at least not directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, heuristic methods can be used to split a multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification datasets and train a binary classification model each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples of these heuristic methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-vs-Rest (OvR)\n",
    "One-vs-One (OvO)\n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at each.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Vs-Rest for Multi-Class Classification\n",
    "One-vs-rest (OvR for short, also referred to as One-vs-All or OvA) is a heuristic method for using binary classification algorithms for multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves splitting the multi-class dataset into multiple binary classification problems. A binary classifier is then trained on each binary classification problem and predictions are made using the model that is the most confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given a multi-class classification problem with examples for each class ‘red,’ ‘blue,’ and ‘green‘. This could be divided into three binary classification datasets as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Classification Problem 1: red vs [blue, green]\n",
    "Binary Classification Problem 2: blue vs [red, green]\n",
    "Binary Classification Problem 3: green vs [red, blue]\n",
    "A possible downside of this approach is that it requires one model to be created for each class. For example, three classes requires three models. This could be an issue for large datasets (e.g. millions of rows), slow models (e.g. neural networks), or very large numbers of classes (e.g. hundreds of classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious approach is to use a one-versus-the-rest approach (also called one-vs-all), in which we train C binary classifiers, fc(x), where the data from class c is treated as positive, and the data from all the other classes is treated as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "— Page 503, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach requires that each model predicts a class membership probability or a probability-like score. The argmax of these scores (class index with the largest score) is then used to predict a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is commonly used for algorithms that naturally predict numerical class membership probability or score, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "Perceptron\n",
    "As such, the implementation of these algorithms in the scikit-learn library implements the OvR strategy by default when using these algorithms for multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate this with an example on a 3-class classification problem using the LogisticRegression algorithm. The strategy for handling multi-class classification can be set via the “multi_class” argument and can be set to “ovr” for the one-vs-rest strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete example of fitting a logistic regression model for multi-class classification using the built-in one-vs-rest strategy is listed below.\n"

    "Each binary classification model may predict one class label and the model with the most predictions or votes is predicted by the one-vs-one strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to introduce K(K − 1)/2 binary discriminant functions, one for every possible pair of classes. This is known as a one-versus-one classifier. Each point is then classified according to a majority vote amongst the discriminant functions.\n",

    "— Page 183, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, 2006.\n",

    "Similarly, if the binary classification models predict a numerical class membership, such as a probability, then the argmax of the sum of the scores (class with the largest sum score) is predicted as the class label.\n",

    "Classically, this approach is suggested for support vector machines (SVM) and related kernel-based algorithms. This is believed because the performance of kernel methods does not scale in proportion to the size of the training dataset and using subsets of the training data may counter this effect.\n",
