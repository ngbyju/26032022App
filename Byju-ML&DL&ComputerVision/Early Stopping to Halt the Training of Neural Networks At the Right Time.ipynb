    "Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into six parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Callbacks in Keras\n",
    "Evaluating a Validation Dataset\n",
    "Monitoring Model Performance\n",
    "Early Stopping in Keras\n",
    "Checkpointing in Keras\n",
    "Early Stopping Case Study\n",
    "Using Callbacks in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks provide a way to execute code and interact with the training model process automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks can be provided to the fit() function via the “callbacks” argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, callbacks must be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "cb = Callback(...)\n",
    "Then, one or more callbacks that you intend to use must be added to a Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "cb_list = [cb, ...]\n",
    "Finally, the list of callbacks is provided to the callback argument when fitting the model.\n",

    "...\n",
    "model.fit(..., callbacks=cb_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a Validation Dataset in Keras\n",
    "Early stopping requires that a validation dataset is evaluated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by specifying the validation dataset to the fit() function when training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first involves you manually splitting your training data into a train and validation dataset and specifying the validation dataset to the fit() function via the validation_data argument. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "model.fit(train_X, train_y, validation_data=(val_x, val_y))\n",
    "Alternately, the fit() function can automatically split your training dataset into train and validation sets based on a percentage split specified via the validation_split argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation_split is a value between 0 and 1 and defines the percentage amount of the training dataset to use for the validation dataset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "model.fit(train_X, train_y, validation_split=0.3)\n",
    "In both cases, the model is not trained on the validation dataset. Instead, the model is evaluated on the validation dataset at the end of each training epoch.\n",

    "\n",
    "The loss function chosen to be optimized for your model is calculated at the end of each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To callbacks, this is made available via the name “loss.”\n",
    "\n",
    "If a validation dataset is specified to the fit() function via the validation_data or validation_split arguments, then the loss on the validation dataset will be made available via the name “val_loss.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional metrics can be monitored during the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be specified when compiling the model via the “metrics” argument to the compile function. This argument takes a Python list of known metric functions, such as ‘mse‘ for mean squared error and ‘accuracy‘ for accuracy. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "model.compile(..., metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "If additional metrics are monitored during training, they are also available to the callbacks via the same name, such as ‘accuracy‘ for accuracy on the training dataset and ‘val_accuracy‘ for the accuracy on the validation dataset. Or, ‘mse‘ for mean squared error on the training dataset and ‘val_mse‘ on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping in Keras\n",
    "Keras supports the early stopping of training via a callback called EarlyStopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "This callback allows you to specify the performance measure to monitor, the trigger, and once triggered, it will stop the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EarlyStopping callback is configured when instantiated via arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “monitor” allows you to specify the performance measure to monitor in order to end training. Recall from the previous section that the calculation of measures on the validation dataset will have the ‘val_‘ prefix, such as ‘val_loss‘ for the loss on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss')\n",
    "Based on the choice of performance measure, the “mode” argument will need to be specified as whether the objective of the chosen metric is to increase (maximize or ‘max‘) or to decrease (minimize or ‘min‘).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we would seek a minimum for validation loss and a minimum for validation mean squared error, whereas we would seek a maximum for validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min')\n",
    "By default, mode is set to ‘auto‘ and knows that you want to minimize loss or maximize accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all that is needed for the simplest form of early stopping. Training will stop when the chosen performance measure stops improving. To discover the training epoch on which training was stopped, the “verbose” argument can be set to 1. Once stopped, the callback will print the epoch number.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1)\n",
    "Often, the first sign of no further improvement may not be the best time to stop training. This is because the model may coast into a plateau of no improvement or even get slightly worse before getting much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can account for this by adding a delay to the trigger in terms of the number of epochs on which we would like to see no improvement. This can be done by setting the “patience” argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1, patience=50)\n",
    "The exact amount of patience will vary between models and problems. Reviewing plots of your performance measure can be very useful to get an idea of how noisy the optimization process for your model on your data may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, any change in the performance measure, no matter how fractional, will be considered an improvement. You may want to consider an improvement that is a specific increment, such as 1 unit for mean squared error or 1% for accuracy. This can be specified via the “min_delta” argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_accuracy', mode='max', min_delta=1)\n",
    "Finally, it may be desirable to only stop training if performance stays above or below a given threshold or baseline. For example, if you have familiarity with the training of the model (e.g. learning curves) and know that once a validation loss of a given value is achieved that there is no point in continuing training. This can be specified by setting the “baseline” argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be more useful when fine tuning a model, after the initial wild fluctuations in the performance measure seen in the early stages of training a new model are past.\n",
    "\n",
    "es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min', baseline=0.4)\n",
    "Checkpointing in Keras\n",
    "The EarlyStopping callback will stop training once triggered, but the model at the end of training may not be the model with best performance on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional callback is required that will save the best model observed during training for later use. This is the ModelCheckpoint callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ModelCheckpoint callback is flexible in the way it can be used, but in this case we will use it only to save the best model observed during training as defined by a chosen performance measure on the validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving and loading models requires that HDF5 support has been installed on your workstation. For example, using the pip Python installer, this can be achieved as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo pip install h5py\n",
    "You can learn more from the h5py Installation documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The callback will save the model to file, which requires that a path and filename be specified via the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "mc = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5')\n",
    "The preferred loss function to be monitored can be specified via the monitor argument, in the same way as the EarlyStopping callback. For example, loss on the validation dataset (the default).\n",
    "\n",
    "mc = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss')\n",
    "Also, as with the EarlyStopping callback, we must specify the “mode” as either minimizing or maximizing the performance measure. Again, the default is ‘auto,’ which is aware of the standard performance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "mc = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', mode='min')\n",
    "Finally, we are interested in only the very best model observed during training, rather than the best compared to the previous epoch, which might not be the best overall if training is noisy. This can be achieved by setting the “save_best_only” argument to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "mc = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', mode='min', save_best_only=True)\n",
    "That is all that is needed to ensure the model with the best performance is saved when using early stopping, or in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be interesting to know the value of the performance measure and at what epoch the model was saved. This can be printed by the callback by setting the “verbose” argument to “1“.\n",
    "\n",
    "mc = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1)\n",
    "The saved model can then be loaded and evaluated any time by calling the load_model() function.\n",

    "Again, we can see that early stopping continued patiently until after epoch 1,000. Note that epoch 894 + a patience of 200 is not epoch 1044. Recall that early stopping is monitoring loss on the validation dataset and that the model checkpoint is saving models based on accuracy on the validation dataset. As such, the patience of early stopping started at an epoch other than 894.\n",

    "This is a good question. The main reason is that accuracy is a coarse measure of model performance during training and that loss provides more nuance when using early stopping with classification problems. The same measure may be used for early stopping and model checkpointing in the case of regression, such as mean squared error."
