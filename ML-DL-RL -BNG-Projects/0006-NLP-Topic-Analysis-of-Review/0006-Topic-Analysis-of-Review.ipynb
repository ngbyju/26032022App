    "\n",
    "#Help a leading mobile brand understand the voice of the customer by analyzing the reviews of their product on Amazon and the topics that customers are talking about. \n",

    "#Problem Statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "#A popular mobile phone brand, Lenovo has launched their budget smartphone in the Indian market. \n",
    "#The client wants to understand the VOC (voice of the customer) on the product. This will be useful to not just evaluate the current product, \n",
    "#but to also get some direction for developing the product pipeline. The client is particularly interested in the different aspects that \n",
    "#customers care about. Product reviews by customers on a leading e-commerce site should provide a good view.\n",

    "#Domain: Amazon reviews for a leading phone brand\n",

    "#Dataset: ‘K8 Reviews v0.2.csv’\n",

    "\n",
    "#Sentiment: The sentiment against the review (4,5 star reviews are positive, 1,2 are negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Reviews: The main text of the review\n",
    "\n",
    "#Steps to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Discover the topics in the reviews and present it to business in a consumable format. \n",
    "#Employ techniques in syntactic processing and topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Perform specific cleanup, POS tagging, and restricting to relevant POS tags, then, perform topic modeling using LDA. \n",
    "#Finally, give business-friendly names to the topics and make a table for business.\n",

    "#Tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "#Read the .csv file using Pandas. Take a look at the top few records.\n",

(yet to enter two sim card & use whatsapp , gmail , so if it continues to become more worst i'd surely update & escalate this )2),camera quality(for a dual camera , it is nowhere near honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in professional mode with manual iso & focussing.a disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .i wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out ota update for camera & battery life improvement.other than that , the phone is super smooth , display , touch , finger print sensor & stock android is a bit of self satisfaction that i can say to myself for wasting 14k .i thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the camera & battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.lost interest to even post pictures of it.with much regret.\",\n",
